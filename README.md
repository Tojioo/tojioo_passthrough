# Tojioo Passthrough Nodes for ComfyUI

Typed passthrough nodes to reduce wire clutter in subgraphs. Includes a multi-type dynamic passthrough, and utility nodes for batch switching among other various quality-of-life improvements.

### Nodes

* **Simple Passthroughs**: Image, Mask, Latent, CLIP, Model, VAE, ControlNet, SAM Model, String, Int, Float, Bool. Muted or bypassed predecessor nodes are gracefully handled (treated as `None`).
* **Conditioning Passthrough**: Positive and negative conditioning. Handles missing/muted inputs.
* **Multi-Passthrough Hub**: Optional inputs with typed outputs.
* **Utility Nodes**:
	+ Dual CLIP Text Encode: Encodes positive and negative prompts into conditioning using a shared CLIP model.
	+ Tiled VAE Settings: Provides tiled VAE encoding/decoding settings as connectable outputs.
* **Dynamic Nodes**:
	+ Dynamic Passthrough: Flexible multi-input passthrough with type mirroring
	+ Dynamic Any: Single input passthrough with type mirroring
	+ Dynamic Bus: Context/bus for carrying multiple typed values
	+ Dynamic Preview: Tabbed multi-input preview for any data type
* **Batch Switch Nodes**: Any Image, Mask, Latent, Conditioning Batch Switch
* **Switch Nodes**: Any Image, Mask, Latent, CLIP, Model, VAE, ControlNet, SAM Model, String, Int, Float, Bool Switch

#### Dual CLIP Text Encode

* Purpose: Encode a positive and negative text prompt into conditioning using a single shared CLIP model, keeping the two encode nodes consolidated.
* Behaviour:
	+ Accepts one CLIP input and two text widgets (positive, negative)
	+ Outputs separate `positive` and `negative` CONDITIONING values

#### Tiled VAE Settings

* Purpose: Bundle tiled VAE encoding/decoding parameters into connectable outputs so they can be routed cleanly through subgraphs without wiring individual widgets.
* Behaviour:
	+ Exposes `tile_size`, `overlap`, `temporal_size`, and `temporal_overlap` as typed outputs
	+ Default values: tile_size 512, overlap 64, temporal_size 64, temporal_overlap 8
	+ All values are adjustable via the built-in widget controls

---

#### Batch Switch Nodes

* Purpose: Combine multiple compatible inputs into a single batch while keeping wiring tidy.
* Behaviour:
	+ Starts with one slot, adds a new slot when the last one gets connected
	+ With a single connected input, passes through unchanged
	+ With multiple connected inputs, builds a batch when shapes are compatible
	+ Muted or bypassed upstream nodes are treated as missing and ignored

#### Example:

---

#### Switch Nodes

* Purpose: Select the first valid connected input, based on slot order.
* Behaviour:
	+ Dynamic inputs auto-add slots
	+ Returns the first connected input by slot number
	+ Muted or bypassed upstream nodes are treated as missing and ignored

#### Example:

<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4eabfea0-4ec4-4a38-83e8-fb391b60afeb" />

---

#### Dynamic Passthrough

* Purpose: A flexible multi-input passthrough where slot types mirror what you connect.
* Behaviour:
	+ Dynamic inputs and outputs, slots grow as you connect
	+ Output slot types mirror their corresponding connected input types
	+ Updates live as connections change

#### Example:

<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/311f7d35-2895-4527-9113-d8c4eaa3aa96" />

---

#### Dynamic Preview

* Purpose: In-graph viewer for inspecting any value across multiple inputs.
* Behaviour:
	+ Accepts any input type — slots grow dynamically as you connect
	+ Images and masks display visually; all other types (strings, tensors, conditioning, etc.) display as formatted text
	+ Switch between inputs via the built-in tab selector, which scrolls horizontally when tabs overflow the node width
	+ No outputs, this node is a pure viewer

#### Example (together with Dynamic Bus Node):
